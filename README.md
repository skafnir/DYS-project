# DYS-project
Donate Your Stuff - web application

The aim of the project is to create a place where everyone can give unnecessary things to trusted institutions. 
The user has things at home that he wants to get rid of, but he does not know how. There are many solutions available, 
but many of them require additional effort or problem lies in lack of trust. To verified places you have to go, while 
there is no time / there is no way to get there, and the containers under the house or local assemblies are unverified 
and it is not known if these things actually reach the needy.

Project still in work.
